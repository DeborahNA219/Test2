## Introduction
Do Americans favor the death penalty for the crime of murder? According to Gallup and the
Pew Research Center, two major polling organizations that regularly ask Americans this
question and whose findings are widely publicized, public support ranges between 55% (Gallup,
September-October, 2020) and 60% (Pew, April 2021).[^1] These findings are generally accepted
as an accurate gauge of current public attitudes: a clear majority in favor of the death penalty for
murder but well below the modern peak of 78-80% in the mid-1990s.

Both Gallup and Pew ask a very generic question. Gallup asks, “Are you in favor of the death
penalty for a person convicted of murder?” Although Pew gives more options to measure level
of support or opposition, its question is otherwise nearly identical: “Do you strongly favor,
favor, oppose or strongly oppose the death penalty for persons convicted of murder?” Most
other polling organizations that have measured public opinion in the United States on the death
penalty in recent decades have asked essentially the same question. One problem is that these
questions do not distinguish between most murders – or, what we might call the “typical” or
”average” murder — and the specific kinds of aggravated murders that make a killer eligible for
the death penalty in the 27 American states with capital punishment.[^2] Someone, for example,
might oppose the death penalty for most murders but support it for, say, raping and murdering
a child, or killing people by setting off a bomb in a public place, or killing someone after
intentionally torturing the victim. How should such a person respond when asked whether he
or she favors the death penalty for “a person convicted of murder”? This person might answer
“no” to the generic question — and thus be counted as a death penalty opponent — even though
he or she would support executing some murderers. A second problem is that the question does
not allow respondents to distinguish between an abstract preference for the death penalty in
some circumstances and the retention or adoption of the death penalty as actual public policy.
Someone who approves of the death penalty in principle might answer “no” to the generic
question because they interpret the question as asking about whether their state should have
the death penalty – a policy they might oppose because of concerns about cost, mistakes, or
discrimination.

Although polling organizations occasionally ask Americans whether they support the death
penalty for a particular offender — such as Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 in the 1995
bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City and who was executed in 2001 (Gallup
reported that 81% approved) — we can find no record in the past three decades of a national
survey that polled Americans on their support for the death penalty for a variety of specific
types of aggravated murder.[^3] To fill this gap in our knowledge of American public opinion on capital punishment, we devised a series of questions on the death penalty that were included in two national surveys (on several distinct topics) of approximately 5000 registered voters. The surveys were conducted online by YouGov in June of 2019.[^4]

## Survey Design
The first survey began the section on capital punishment by alerting respondents that we would
be asking about the death penalty for “different kinds of aggravated murders,” indicating
that they could skip these questions: 92% did not. We then asked whether the respondent
“support[ed] the death penalty for the crime of murder” and gave three optional responses: 
1. “I support the death penalty for most or all types of murder.”
2. “I support the death penalty only for the most aggravated murders.”
3. “I oppose the death penalty for most or all types of murder.” 

In our view, these options rectified the deficiency in the Gallup/Pew generic question because
they allowed us to distinguish between two types of death-penalty supporters: those who would
use the ultimate punishment for most or all murders and those who would use it only for the most
aggravated murders.

The second survey had a more complex design. While it was also implemented by YouGov, it
was a separate sample from the 2019 survey.[^5] The respondents were divided into four groups
of equal size. The first two groups were asked to list everything that comes to mind when they
think about the debate over the death penalty in the United States. Half of these individuals
were then asked the standard Gallup question measuring death-penalty support, and half were
asked the same question we posed in our 2019 survey. The third group was asked first to list
what comes to mind when they think of murder victims and their families, and then they were
asked the same death-penalty support question as in our 2019 survey. The fourth group was
asked to list what comes to mind when they think about the possibility of an innocent person
being executed, and then they were asked the same death-penalty support question as in our 2019
survey. The purpose of this design was to test whether “framing” the debate in a certain way
(the third and fourth groups) would affect the results. As the project’s future publications will
demonstrate, the framing had a very small effect on our measurements of death-penalty support,
and (as expected) our question yielded higher levels of support than the Gallup question. This
report describes some of the key findings of the two surveys, using the second group (the control
group) of respondents from the 2020 survey. This group had the most directly comparable
survey to those who took our 2019 survey. As we detail here, the results of the 2020 survey were
quite similar to those from the 2019 survey.

## General support for the death penalty
Table 1 presents the results of the two surveys on general support for the death penalty.

By adding the first two rows for each survey, we see that large majorities supported the death
penalty for at least some types of murder. For those who responded to this question in 2019, fully
three-fourths — 76% — voiced support. In the 2020 survey, the figure was 72%. Both of these
figures are much higher than the 55-60% measured by Gallup and Pew (and most other polling
organizations) using the generic question. Because 8% of those surveyed in 2019 did not answer
the death-penalty questions, we cannot know their position on capital punishment. Yet even if

all of them opposed the death penalty for most or all types of murder (which, of course, is quite
unlikely), we would still have 70% favoring the death penalty for at least some murders.

about six aggravated murders: “Murder especially brutal”; “Murder for hire”; “Victim is child”;
“Victim is police officer”; “Victim is prison guard”; “Convicted of killing more than one.”

[^4]: Although many reputable and widely publicized surveys (including those published and
analyzed in peer-reviewed social science journals) use voter registration lists to identify
participants, there is always the possibility that the views of registered voters (67% of all
American citizens of voting age in 2018, according to the Census Bureau) may differ from the
views of those who do not register to vote. In 2018, the Pew Research Center (which has now
moved most of its polling online), conducted a major study that compared Americans’ opinions
on a variety of issues when derived from two kinds of samples: one based on random digit
dialing (which would include those not registered to vote) and another based on voter files. Pew
found that for 56 of the 65 different questions, the results were “statistically indistinguishable.”
This included the question on the death penalty. See Pew Research Center, “Comparing Survey
Sampling Strategies: Random-Digit Dial vs. Voter Files,” October 9, 2018, at https://www.
