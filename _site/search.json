    "title": "How Many Americans Support the Death Penalty?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Do Americans favor the death penalty for the crime of murder? According to Gallup and the Pew Research Center, two major polling organizations that regularly ask Americans this question and whose findings are widely publicized, public support ranges between 55% (Gallup, September-October, 2020) and 60% (Pew, April 2021).2 These findings are generally accepted as an accurate gauge of current public attitudes: a clear majority in favor of the death penalty for murder but well below the modern peak of 78-80% in the mid-1990s.\nBoth Gallup and Pew ask a very generic question. Gallup asks, “Are you in favor of the death penalty for a person convicted of murder?” Although Pew gives more options to measure level of support or opposition, its question is otherwise nearly identical: “Do you strongly favor, favor, oppose or strongly oppose the death penalty for persons convicted of murder?” Most other polling organizations that have measured public opinion in the United States on the death penalty in recent decades have asked essentially the same question. One problem is that these questions do not distinguish between most murders – or, what we might call the “typical” or ”average” murder — and the specific kinds of aggravated murders that make a killer eligible for the death penalty in the 27 American states with capital punishment. Someone, for example, might oppose the death penalty for most murders but support it for, say, raping and murdering a child, or killing people by setting off a bomb in a public place, or killing someone after intentionally torturing the victim. How should such a person respond when asked whether he or she favors the death penalty for “a person convicted of murder”? This person might answer “no” to the generic question — and thus be counted as a death penalty opponent — even though he or she would support executing some murderers. A second problem is that the question does not allow respondents to distinguish between an abstract preference for the death penalty in some circumstances and the retention or adoption of the death penalty as actual public policy. Someone who approves of the death penalty in principle might answer “no” to the generic question because they interpret the question as asking about whether their state should have the death penalty – a policy they might oppose because of concerns about cost, mistakes, or discrimination.\nAlthough polling organizations occasionally ask Americans whether they support the death penalty for a particular offender — such as Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 in the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City and who was executed in 2001 (Gallup reported that 81% approved) — we can find no record in the past three decades of a national survey that polled Americans on their support for the death penalty for a variety of specific types of aggravated murder. To fill this gap in our knowledge of American public opinion on capital punishment, we devised a series of questions on the death penalty that were included in two national surveys (on several distinct topics) of approximately 5000 registered voters. The surveys were conducted online by YouGov in June of 2019.5\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(r\"C:\\Users\\Maya\\Documents\\RoseData\\Quarto\\Test2\\Partial1.csv\")\ndata.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nSupport for most or all types of murder\nSupport only for the most aggravated murders\nOppose for most or all types of murder\nUnnamed: 4\nUnnamed: 5\nUnnamed: 6\n\n\n\n\n0\nVery liberal\n14%\n29%\n56%\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n1\nLiberal\n19%\n44%\n37%\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n2\nModerate\n35%\n44%\n22%\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n3\nConservative\n52%\n38%\n10%\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n4\nVery\\nconservative\n65%\n26%\n9%\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a note, I took it out for October, since the data must be tidy, else it looks like:"
